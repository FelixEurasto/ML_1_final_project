# ML_1_final_project
Final project for Introduction to Machine Learning course

In this project, the goal was to predict on which days a meteorological phenomenon called "npf" will occur. This is done using the file "npf_train.csv", which contains measurements of a total of 100 meteorological variables (458 measurement of each variable). Additionally, the goal was to predict which type of npf will occur on a given day.


Npf is short for "new particle formation", which means large particles forming from smaller particles in the atmosphere. Npf has health implications and effects on on e.g. cloud formation.

I built a logistic regression model to predict which days were npf days and another logistic regression model to predict the type of npf event happened on the days predicted to be npf days.
